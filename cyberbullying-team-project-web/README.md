## 🔍 Project Overview

Teenagers often struggle to recognise cyberbullying, understand how to respond, and know where to seek help.  
Our web application tackles this challenge through a **space-themed, story-driven learning experience** guided by **Gleepo**, a friendly alien who leads users through a safe and engaging anti-cyberbullying journey.

To help teens build real recognition and help-seeking skills, the platform combines:

- **Interactive data visualisations** — transforming abstract cyberbullying statistics into relatable, classroom-level insights.
- **Gamified learning** — teaching teens to differentiate between normal online behaviour and harmful interactions.
- **Real teen stories (video content)** — fostering emotional connection, validation, and awareness that they’re not alone.
- **AI-powered text checking** — identifying toxic or harmful language.
- **Resource pathways** — clear, easy-to-navigate links to professional support, reporting tools, and trusted adult advice.

This blend of **AI**, **data visualisation**, **game-based learning**, and **narrative design** makes the platform educational, relatable, and accessible for teenagers.

## ⭐ My Contributions

As the team’s **Data Scientist & Backend Engineer**, I was responsible for all data workflows, analytical components, backend logic for interactive features, and multiple AI-powered modules.

My key contributions include:

- **Topic Research & Dataset Analysis**  
  *(researching cyberbullying patterns, identifying risks for teens, cleaning and merging datasets, preparing formatted CSVs — R)*

- **Interactive Visualisations**  
  *(cyberbullying statistics & social media trends — fully designed and implemented React prototypes)*

- **“Clean My Feed” — Game API Development**  
  *(AWS Lambda + AWS MySQL backend logic for gameplay, scoring, analytics feedback)*

- **AI Toxicity Detection API**  
  *(FastAPI service integrating Hugging Face models + Gemini; logs predictions and paraphrased text to AWS MySQL)*

### Topic Research & Dataset Analysis

Conducted research and analyzed multiple datasets on teen cyberbullying.  

- Cleaned, merged, and formatted data in R for consistent use.  
- Produced statistics to guide visualisation and gameplay design.  
- Prepared CSVs for backend and interactive features.  

---

### Interactive Visualisations

I designed and implemented two interactive visualisations to make cyberbullying statistics engaging for teenagers:

- **Visualisation 1 – "How My Class Looks Like":**  
  A personalised snapshot of cyberbullying prevalence, showing teens they are not alone and encouraging them to seek help. 
  *(Displayed on the website under **“Cyber Stats”**)*

### “Clean My Feed” — Game API Development

Backend logic for **“Clean My Feed”**, a gamified learning experience helping teenagers identify cyberbullying in realistic comments. Focused on **data-driven gameplay, personalised feedback, and analytical insights**.

**Key Components:**

- **Comment Delivery API (AWS Lambda + MySQL)**  
  - Retrieves and shuffles comments from the database.  
  - Balanced exposure: 4 positive + 6 non-positive comments per block.  
  - Returns comments in JSON format with CORS headers.

   
- **Feedback API (AWS Lambda + MySQL)**  
  - Processes player submissions and validates responses against labelled comments.  
  - Calculates scores, highlights mistakes, and identifies growth areas.  
  - Logs submissions and responses for analytics.  
  - Returns detailed summaries:  
    - Correct vs incorrect responses  
    - Weak areas by bullying type  
    - Comparative performance with other users  
    - Total score and percentile ranking
